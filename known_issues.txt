Known issues. Will move this to github later; just needed a scratchpad.

1.  Batching: Pressing the reset button doesn't properly reset the variable for
    batches to make, but does reset the label.

    Workaround: return to main menu, then re-launch batching.

2.  Pressing the done button doesn't work as intended. Not properly reseting 
    batching variable, similar to 1. Likely both are related to
    "update_batch_specs" not working correctly.

    Workaround: return to main menu, then re-launch batching.

Pre-Start Checks

1.  Caldera Importer needs to check for proper batch folder structure
